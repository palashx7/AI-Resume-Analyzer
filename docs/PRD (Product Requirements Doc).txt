PRD — AI Resume Analyzer & Job Match Platform
1. Overview

Product Name: AI Resume Analyzer & Job Match Platform
Type: Full-stack web application
Goal: Help job seekers analyze their resume against a job description (JD), understand skill gaps, and improve their resume content using AI-assisted insights (free/open-source approach).

2. Problem Statement

Many students and early professionals apply for jobs without knowing:

Whether their resume matches the job role

How ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) filter resumes

As a result, users face repeated rejections and low shortlisting rates.

3. Target Users
Primary Users

Final-year engineering students

Freshers applying for internships/jobs

Early professionals switching roles (0–2 years experience)

Secondary Users (Optional)

Mentors/coaches who review resumes

HR/recruiters (limited access)

4. User Goals / Use Cases

Users want to:

Upload a resume PDF and extract resume text correctly

Paste a job description and check match score

Get improvement suggestions for resume content and bullet points

Save analysis history for future tracking

Generate a downloadable report to share/keep

8. Functional Requirements

System should handle PDF parsing reliably

Must return analysis within reasonable time (e.g., < 10 seconds)

Must store analysis results for future viewing

Must ensure data is secure and user-specific (no cross-user access)

9. Non-Functional Requirements

Clean UI, responsive design

Secure file upload

Input validation on all APIs

Error messages must be user-friendly

Use only free/open-source AI methods

10. Edge Cases & Validation

Resume PDF has images only → show “Unable to extract text properly”

Resume is empty or too short → warn user

JD is too short → ask for more details

User uploads non-PDF → reject

Large PDF → reject with size message

AI similarity model slow → fallback to ATS-only scoring

11. Success Metrics (for internship evaluation)

At least 1 fully deployed working web application

Resume parsing works correctly for most PDFs

Analysis output is structured and meaningful

Project has:

authentication

history

report export

clean UI

proper README

12. Scope Boundary (What we won’t do now)

Real-time job scraping from job portals

External paid APIs like OpenAI

Real ATS system integration

Multilingual resume support (optional later)
